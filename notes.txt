NOTES
-----

2024/08/02 - I had trouble with pushing the repo to Github initially after doing the commits in RStudio.
To resolve the issue, I created an empty repo with the same name as the project ("UNECE_abst2word"), then performed the below in the Terminal in RStudio:

  "
  â€¦or push an existing repository from the command line
  git remote add origin https://github.com/thoughthollow/UNECE_abst2word.git
  git branch -M main
  git push -u origin main
  "
